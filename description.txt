ItemMagnetPlus adds a single item called "Item Magnet" that does the obvious thing: Sucking in items around you so you don't have to run around and collect them yourself.

Adds:
Item Magnet (and corresponding buff) that
* can be crafted with simple materials (Iron/Lead)
* works while in your inventory (doesn't waste an accessory slot)
* can be toggled on and off
* has adjustable range and item succ speed
* has increased stats after killing bosses
* customizable via config (\Documents\My Games\Terraria\ModLoader\Mod Configs) to fit your playstyle

How to use:
* Left click cycles through its ranges
* Right click shows current range (you can always check the stats on the buff tooltip)
* This right click functionality changes to "turn off" when "buff" flag in the config is set to 0
* Killing bosses improves its stats
* If you want it to either be off or on, there is a config entry called "scale", set it to 0 or 2

Multiplayer:
* This mod is multiplayer compatible, the config is entirely server side, but the buff flag is forced to 1
* Items that are inbetween two players with magnets will "float"
* Due to the way the "grab delay" is only set in singleplayer, items dropped by the player will instantly latch onto the player, which is normal behavior
* Items might not get sucked up and turn into a "ghost" with the Auto Trash Mod enabled
* Lost items due to this bug won't be recovered
* Report any bugs in the forum thread

Progression: (default config)
 Starts with:
 Range = 10 (Blocks in each direction)
 Velocity = 8
 Acceleration = 8

 Ends with: (killing Moonlord)
 Range = 120 (one and a half screens)
 Velocity = 32
 Acceleration = 32

 About the config:
* Buff decides if it gives you a corresponding buff icon to show the status of the magnet
* Filter decides what to ignore when using the magnet (only hearts, mana stars and coins supported for now)
* Range starts from 10, but can be as big as you want
* If you increase Vel or Acc too much from those recommended above, items might get "stuck" on you until you deactivate it again
* Beware of lag when increasing these values, especially range
* If the difference between velocity and acceleration is too big, items will go in circles around you or get stuck until you deactivate it
* If you change the version number, your config might get reset, so don't touch it
